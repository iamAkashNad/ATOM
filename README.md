# ATOM - A Code Editor x Compiler

This project is a MERN Stack project.And it Supports C, C++, Java, JavaScript & Python.

## Purpose

This editor's main audience are the begginers who just start coding. I basically want to less the pain of installing this and that environment & software for coding. And also the pain of signup & login and then remember the credentials before start coding on any online editor. In ATOM, you just need a laptop or mobile and internet start coding. Simple & Easy!
